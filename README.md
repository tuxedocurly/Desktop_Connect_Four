This is an implementation of a *Desktop Connect Four Game* built using the Java Swing library.

<p>Tired of playing Tic-Tac-Toe? Want something a little more challenging? Connect Four is a great game that fuses the complexity of a larger game board and the need to line up more pieces. This game contains a GUI that you can run on any desktop platform (Window, Mac OS, Linux) to play locally with a friend.</p></div><br/><br/>
